Functionality issues:
--Safari greek has gaps (look at text in other browsers)
--Performance is the main issue to solve for the scholars
--Once you use crop, the move (hand) tool is no longer functioning on the image - DONE
--Turning layers offâ€”add "off" to the front of the name (or parentheses); start with "on", toggle - DONE
--Turn zoomable box on by default - DONE
--Take out global opacity - DONE
--Allow panels to be dragged off-screen - DONE
--Add home link left of "image" on panel; returns to 1st panel for prayerbook/undertext, and 2nd panel for the rest; also add link to 1st panel from second panel - DONE
--Can "crop" go on the panel itself rather than global? - DONE

--Change layer names to sth more intelligible, and terse (Will will send list)
--SubLayer Object turns itself on/off in the wrong sequence (Turn layer off, then change opacity)
--Author and work list; only first three are authors; add "unknown" and then have "Menaion," Saint Pyth, unknown A and B on the right
--Make side panels collapsible - DONE - needs to be styled
--When you select a different author in second intro panel, the original one stays highlighted too

Phase 2 (Beyond the scholars):
1. Searching tool for text content
2. Importable style sheets
3. Quickly disable/enable all the images
4. Custom presets - page order, layer order (shareable)
5. Performance issues
6. Indication of what each layer name means

(Prayer Book 028V-21r - really cool image)
